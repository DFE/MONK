This module implements device handling. Using the classes from this module you
can abstract a complete :term:`target device` in a single object. On
instantiation you give it some connections and then (theoretically) let the
device handle the rest.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    import monk_tf.dev as md
    import monk_tf.conn as mc
    # create a device with a ssh connection and a serial connection
    d=md.Device(
        mc.SshConn('192.168.2.100', 'tester', 'secret'),
        mc.SerialConn('/dev/ttyUSB2', 'root', 'muchmoresecret'),
    )
    # send a command (the same way as with connections)
    return_code, output = d.cmd('ls -al')
    print output
    [...]
