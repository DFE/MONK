        itself and the prompt afterwards are the borders of the command output,
        that is returned.

        The basic structure of a command is like that::

            <something left in the buffer><our command><EOL>
            <command output> # optional (EOLs inside the command output are treated as any character)

                        most.

        This function reads everything available in the buffer, then waits
        ``sleep_time`` seconds and then starts again, either until it finds
        ``end_strip`` in the buffered text or the ``timeout`` runs out.
        Everything will be deleted, beginning from the ``end_strip``, because
        that is expected to be knowledge the user already has.
        
        The same way as ``end_strip`` works on the end, you can also define a
        ``start_strip``, which will delete everything in the buffer until the
        start_strip is found.

        All of that is a generalization of how the method is used in cmd(). The
        idea is that a command line execution over serial repeats the written
        command, then writes the command output and finally prints a new
        prompt. Therefore it makes sense to look for the command and the prompt
        as the delimiters of the desired part of the output.

        excepted by :py:func:`str.find`.

                        most.

                 timeout didn't deplete. The second param contains the output
                 as far as it was received.
