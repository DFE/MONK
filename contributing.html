<p>Our project lives from your contributions. That is why we took a lot of effort
to make contributing to <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a> as easy as possible. Following the guide
on this page leads you to your first steps developing with and for
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a>. If you want to get into the details look at the next section:
<a class="reference internal" href="devel.html#chap-devel"><em>Development Process</em></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="prerequisites">
<span id="contrib-pre"></span><h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a> is written in <strong>Python 2.7</strong>, which means it is mostly self
contained and able to work on any operating system. Not all OS dependencies
can be obvious, though. This means, that in some places you might have to
investigate a solution by yourself. Feel free to drop us a line, though. Maybe
we already faced your problem before or might include your solution as your
first contribution!</p>
<p>Most <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a> developers work on Ubuntu, Suse and Fedora systems. If you
have one of those systems, chances are that you will be able to follow this
guide without any problems. This document itself is written on a <strong>Ubuntu
13.04</strong> machine and all examples have been tested on that platform.</p>
<p>On most Linux distributions Python 2.7 should already be installed, so you
have nothing to do in that regard. To test it, open a terminal and look if
that works without an error message:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ python
Python 2.7.4 (default, Apr 19 2013, 18:28:01)
[GCC 4.7.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; print "hi"
hi
&gt;&gt;&gt; exit()</pre>
</div>
<p>If it worked, then you already have Python and are ready to go. If not, you
might find information on how to get it on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/getit/">the Python website</a>.</p>
<p>Another requirement is the version control system used for <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a>. It is
called <strong>git</strong> and you can find a lot of information about it in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/book">git&nbsp;book</a>. To follow this guide it is not necessary to know everything about
git, though.  Do not worry about it. The only thing you should have a look at
is the <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Installing Git</a> chapter.</p>
<p>Then you will need two development packages. One is <strong>python-dev</strong> (might be
called <em>python-devel</em> on some systems) and the other one
is <strong>libssh-2-1-dev</strong> (sometimes called <em>libssh2-devel</em>). They are necessary
to build the Python package <em>libssh2</em>, which can be installed for you
automatically, if you have the 2 <em>*-dev</em> packages installed. Those are
packages created by your operating system vendor and you should use his
resources to get them. On Ubuntu 13.04 you can do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ sudo apt-get install python-dev libssh-2-1-dev</pre>
</div>
<p>You will also need a Python tool, that helps with generalizing
development environments. It is called <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a>. If your operating
system does not come with a prebuilt <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a>, you can follow the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/#installation">virtualenv Installation Guide</a>.</p>
<p>And, of course, you will need <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK&#8217;s</em></a> source code. If you have
installed <em>git</em> on your system, you can go to your preferred development
folder and do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ git clone https://github.com/DFE/MONK</pre>
</div>
<p>This will create a new folder in that location and will download the source
code inside.</p>
<p>You are now ready to start developing for <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a>. Great!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="starting-the-environment">
<span id="contrib-startenv"></span><h2>Starting The Environment<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-the-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We now want to discuss how to start our virtual environment. It requires an
additional step before and after your editing, but it comes with a lot of
advantages. The tool that helps us here is <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a>, which creates a
defined local environment. It resets standard variables like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PATH</span></tt> and
creates additional folders at the position of your <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a>. Using it
provides the following advantages:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>All developers using the same <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a> initialization work in
pretty much the same environment.</li>
<li>You separate your development environment from your system, which might be
a good idea, if you normally use another python version or another set of
python packages.</li>
<li>A lot of tools and services expect to run python code in a
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a>. So it is always good to be prepared for it.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Working with <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a> requires the following steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a> (only once).</li>
<li>Initialize the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a> (every time before you work).</li>
<li>Install the requirements (once in the beginning, and updated when changed).</li>
<li>Develop, test and do whatever you need to do.</li>
<li>Deactivate the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a> (every time after you are finished with
your work).</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To create the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a> <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></tt> into your <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a> folder, and then
run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>MONK$ virtualenv .</pre>
</div>
<p>Run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></tt> now. You will see there are a lot of new folders which
are not part of the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a> repository. Those were created by
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a> and normally you do not need to touch them directly.</p>
<p>Every time before you start working on something you should run this command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>MONK$ . bin/activate
(MONK)MONK$</pre>
</div>
<p>If the activation was successful, you should see the name of the folder
within braces in front of your prompt. If you do not see it, then please
refer to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The next step you need to do is install the requirements. If you want to test,
you can install <em>requirements-tests.txt</em> and if you want to develop you can
install <em>requirements-develop.txt</em>. Because it does not hurt, we will just
install both now:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(MONK)MONK$ pip install -r requirements-test.txt
(MONK)MONK$ pip install -r requirements-develop.txt</pre>
</div>
<p>Remember that this step only needs to be done once in the beginning and whenever
these file got updated. If there are no changes it does not hurt to call them
again as it should not change anything.</p>
<p>Next you want to install <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a> inside of your <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a> in a
way, that makes it possible to test and to develop it. This is achieved with
the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(MONK)MONK$ python setup.py develop</pre>
</div>
<p>After you are finished, you deactivate <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a> with this command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(MONK)MONK$ deactivate
MONK$</pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the name in braces in front of the prompt is gone and you are
back in normal mode.</p>
<p>Now you know everything you need to start working with <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a>.
Awesome!</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">You need to install the requirements-test.txt file and execute
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">setup.py</span> <span class="pre">develop</span></tt> before you can go on with this part! See
<a class="reference internal" href="#contrib-startenv"><em>Starting The Environment</em></a> for a setup.</p>
</div>
<p>By now we have prepared our system, retrieved the source code for
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a>, and we have seen how to use <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a> to start our
development environment. As a first example of doing stuff, we want to run
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK&#8217;s</em></a> <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-test-suite"><em class="xref std std-term">test&nbsp;suite</em></a>. This will also demonstrate if
everything has been installed correctly.</p>
<p>To run the test suite go into the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a> and then run the setup
command for <strong>nosetests</strong>. <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-nose"><em class="xref std std-term">Nose</em></a> is a tool that finds and runs
test suites while also collecting coverage data. This tool should have been
installed automatically while running MONK&#8217;s setup. You only need to worry a
bout it in case of errors or when you start to write unit tests yourself.
In that case refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">nosetests documentation</a>.</p>
<p>To run <em>nose</em> use:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>MONK$ . bin/activate
(MONK)MONK$ python setup.py nosetests</pre>
</div>
<p>This command will install all required python packages locally into the folder.
Read the output carefully. In general you should see successful attempts to
download and install some packages, then a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DEBUG</span></tt> output, where <em>nose</em>
searches the path for all kinds of tests, then tests and their success,
followed by the coverage data and a short summary that should be successful.
If you experience errors in this step you might consider contacting
our mailing list (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:project-monk&#37;&#52;&#48;dresearch-fe&#46;de">project-monk<span>&#64;</span>dresearch-fe<span>&#46;</span>de</a>)!</p>
<p>To check if it is working, you can go into one file that is being tested and
change something. Because we can be sure that there is a test for
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">monk_tf/serial_conn.py</span></tt>, we will use it as an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(MONK)MONK$ vim monk_tf/conn.py #or any editor of your choice</pre>
</div>
<p>In that file add a line with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">raise</span> <span class="pre">Exception(&quot;Hello</span> <span class="pre">Error!&quot;)</span></tt> in the
constructor of <a class="reference internal" href="monk_tf.html#monk_tf.conn.SerialConnection" title="monk_tf.conn.SerialConnection"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">SerialConnection</span></tt></a> (the
<tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__()</span></tt> method).  If you run the
tests again with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">setup.py</span> <span class="pre">nosetests</span></tt> from the project&#8217;s root folder
(<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a> in our example), the tests with <a class="reference internal" href="monk_tf.html#module-monk_tf.conn" title="monk_tf.conn"><tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">conn</span></tt></a> should
all fail with that exception.</p>
<p>After you are finished, you can remove the exception and do not forget to
<em>deactivate</em> your environment:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(MONK)MONK$ deactivate</pre>
</div>
<p>The interesting point is, that you can now test on the go while developing,
much like an IDE would offer you. In contrast to the IDE, however, you know
that you have the same environment as other developers, users, and your
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">CI&nbsp;server</a>, in our case <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/DFE/MONK">Travis&nbsp;CI</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reading-the-documentation">
<span id="contrib-read"></span><h2>Reading the Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-the-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a> documentation is written in <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a>.
Sphinx is a set of tools, which compiles documents in the
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-rest"><em class="xref std std-term">reStructuredText</em></a> markup language to different formats like HTML
and PDF. <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-rest"><em class="xref std std-term">reST</em></a> is a language that is both written for compilers to parse
and humans to read.  That makes reading <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-rest"><em class="xref std std-term">.rst</em></a> directly in your
editor possible. Text editors like Vim will even highlight the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-rest"><em class="xref std std-term">reST</em></a>
format for you. So the simplest way to read the documentation will be directly
in the source tree:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(MONK)MONK$ cd doc/source
#read this page's source file:
(MONK)MONK$ vim contributing.rst</pre>
</div>
<p>Another way to read the docs, is on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/DFE/MONK/blob/dev/doc/source/contributing.rst">the corresponding GitHub page</a>, but make
sure that you are at the right commit. The advantages of the website are that
you do not need any environment for reading it, GitHub already parses it to
HTML for you and you can even edit the text there. This might be a suitable way
to handle changes in the documentation, although we have not tested
this so far.</p>
<p>The more advanced way is to build the documentation&#8217;s PDF or HTML files yourself.
This will be explained in the next section. The advantages offered by this
approach are that you may read all the warnings and error messages and have
full control over every part of your documentation. If you want to be a
successful <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a> developer this is definitely the way to go.
It is not the easiest, but we trust you can handle it!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="building-the-documentation">
<span id="contrib-build"></span><h2>Building the Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#building-the-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As always the first step is to go into your <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a> repository and
activate <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ cd &lt;MONK&gt;
MONK$ . bin/activate
(MONK)MONK$</pre>
</div>
<p>Change into the doc folder:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(MONK)MONK$ cd doc
(MONK)doc$</pre>
</div>
<p>When you look into that folder you can see that there is a <em>Makefile</em> that
contains tasks for everything you might want to do. In general you just want
the html docs. In that case you call:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(MONK)doc$ make html</pre>
</div>
<p>If you want to build everything and decide what to use later on, then:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(MONK)doc$ make</pre>
</div>
<p>Keep in mind that building everything requires some LaTeX related system
libraries. Until now we have no complete list of those and instead
install the LyX LaTeX editor, which automatically installs all required
packages (and some more):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(MONK)doc$ deactivate
doc$ sudo apt-get install lyx
doc$ . ../bin/activate
(MONK)doc$ make</pre>
</div>
<p>We only rarely use the PDF files, which is why nobody got around to
improving that part. So if you prefer using PDF files, then we would appreciate
your commits there!</p>
<p>The Make script begins by trying to delete old folders that might still be
lying around. Then <em>Sphinx</em> is started and the output you see is produced by
<em>Sphinx</em> going through its compilation process, followed by the output from
<em>latexpdf</em> a tool to generate PDF files from text files.</p>
<p>If everything ran successfully, you should find the following documents, which
can be opened with a browser or a PDF reader, respectively:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">MONK</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">doc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">build</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">html</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">html</span>
<span class="n">MONK</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">doc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">build</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">latex</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">MONK</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pdf</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For problems with building the HTML you should refer to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx Documentation</a>. For problems with building the PDF we cannot help you.
Sorry! But we wish you a great deal of luck! :)</p>
<p>When finished, do not forget to deactivate your <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a>:</p>

<div class="section" id="history-lesson">
<span id="contrib-history"></span><h3>History Lesson<a class="headerlink" href="#history-lesson" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This tutorial was developed because one of our developers felt, that the
previous version of this document was not very helpful for new users. It was
basically a list of details about the development process, with too much
information and too little guidance. So when the time was right and enough
changes to the development process had been made, this tutorial was created to
help newcomers to get involved in <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-open-source"><em class="xref std std-term">open&nbsp;source</em></a>
development. Although there is probably still a lot of room for improvement, we
hope we at least succeeded in convincing you to work with us on <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a>.</p>
<p>The problem was discovered by erikb85 (GitHub username).
When he noticed the problem, he started <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/DFE/MONK/issues/36">an&nbsp;issue</a> on our
developer platform GitHub. In this issue he described the problem. Because in
this case he already knew the solution to the problem, he described that
as well. In most cases the solution will not be clear. Then that part of
the issue description stays empty until a solution is found.</p>
<p>Afterwards he fetched the newest version of <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a> from GitHub. Because
he already had a development environment, it was not necessary to clone
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>#go to the MONK folder
$ cd MONK
#make sure to be on the right branch
MONK$ git checkout dev
#pull updates from Github
MONK$ git pull --rebase</pre>
</div>
<p>He then created a feature branch for his new commits:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>MONK$ git checkout -b f-docs-devenv</pre>
</div>
<p>He added the name of this branch to the <em>Notes</em> section of the issue.</p>
<p>Now he started the development environment and changed to the documentation
folder:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>MONK$ . bin/activate
(MONK)MONK$ cd doc
(MONK)doc$</pre>
</div>
<p>Then he started to edit <em>contributing.rst</em> and built the html documentation
to check his results:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(MONK)doc$ vim source/contributing.rst
(MONK)doc$ make html
...
(MONK)doc$ chromium-browser build/html/contributing.html
# repeat until happy or time runs out</pre>

<p>Whenever he left work, he committed his changes in form of a WIP commit, always
mentioning the GitHub Issue with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#36</span></tt>. This way GitHub always knew which
issue the commits belonged to and could list them accordingly:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(MONK)doc$ git add source/contributing.rst
(MONK)doc$ git commit -s
#commit message:
WIP: contributing.rst: Rewrite for development env

See Github Issue #36.

Signed-off-by: Erik Bernoth &lt;erik.bernoth@gmail.com&gt;
#end of commit message
#be careful with the following command, because it influences the internal
#structure of your git repository as well as GitHub's
(MONK)doc$ git push -f origin f-docs-devenv</pre>
</div>
<p>This ensures the most up-to-date version is always available at GitHub and all
commits are listed in the GitHub issue. Some major decisions are also added as
comments to the issue. One example is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/DFE/MONK/issues/36#issuecomment-18195272">the comment</a>, which
discusses changes to the issue topic, which seemed meaningful at some point
while working on solving it. The comments also are a place for reviewers,
interested users, and other developers to discuss their ideas about the problem.</p>
<p>After this tutorial was finished, it was the labelled <em>reviewable</em> and other
developers took a closer look at it. A reviewer will checkout the same branch
(not a specific commit) and evaluate the results. If code was changed he will
check what exactly was done and if the code still works as expected, if unit
tests are there, if they succeed, and if the coding style guide was followed.
If he is happy, he will add a comment containing a simple <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ACK</span></tt>. Sometimes
it gets more complicated and he will communicate with the developer directly.
This will result in more commits by the reviewers or some changes by the
developer himself. If two reviewers give an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ACK</span></tt> in comments or directly to
the developer he or a maintainer will amend all commits by adding a line for
each reviewer to the commit message, stating that this commit was checked by
them:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>TODO: add Acked-by line according to Issues #36 reviewers. If you are a
reviewer and read this, add an Acked-by example with your name here,
please.</pre>
</div>
<p>Then a maintainer will close the issue and merge the feature branch with the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dev</span></tt> branch, thereby solving the issue.</p>
<p>As you might have noticed, the last steps were explained more broadly. They
require a deeper understanding of git and by that point, a <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a>
developer will probably already help you, anyway.</p>

<p>Okay, that closes the tutorial. Now you have learned all the steps in the
development process and seen one example of how they were applied. You should
know why and how to use <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-virtualenv"><em class="xref std std-term">virtualenv</em></a>, git, GitHhub and <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a>.
The next chapters contain more detailed descriptions. We hope, you were able to
learn something and wish you a good time developing on <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-monk"><em class="xref std std-term">MONK</em></a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading to this point!</p>
